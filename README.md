# Dead Simple Modeling Language

Do you want to suck all the ~~fun~~ _complexity_ out of modeling? Try __DSML__!

## Design Philosophy

The goal of this project is to develop a language for software modeling that
is easy to read, write, use, adapt, and extend. At its core, DSML admits that
the problems which drive developers to modeling are often highly domain
specific or culturally sensitive. No technology solves every problems, but
every technology requires a human to design. What's the point of a technology
that only machines can understand? How do we expect to ever build on top of a
platform that's at least as difficult to master as whatever is underneath it?

With that said, DSML has a pretty ambitious goal: _design for humans_.
